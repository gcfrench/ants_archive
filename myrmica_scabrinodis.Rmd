## Worker
Member of *Myrmicinae* with two segments to waist and sting present.

Like *Myrmica vandeli* **[antennal scape](#glossary)** angled with ball and socket joint on different axis with **[scape process ](#glossary)** rotated about 45 degrees though less hairy than this species. Unlike *Myrmica sabuelti* **[antennal scape](#glossary)** only has narrow longitudinal ridge or flange at most. **[Petiole](#glossary)** with horizontal plate and upper surface angled into hind face.

Steals prey, found near nests of *Lasius flavus* and other ant species.

## Nest
Under stones, bare soil and tussocks in sunny sites that are not extremely dry, rural and suburban areas but absent from uncultivated arable farmland. Shares mounds with *Lasius flavus*. Nests formed by single queens foraging to rear few small workers in the following year that then increases to few hundred workers. Parasitised by *Myrmica karavajevi* when continues to produce workers but no alates. Pupae naked.

## Alates
Mating flights in July. Unlike *Myrmica vandeli* and *Myrmica sabuelti* males have short **[scape](#glossary)** and unlike *Myrmica specioides* with long erect hairs to **[scape](#glossary)** and legs.
