## Worker
Member of *Myrmicinae* with **two segments to waist** and **sting present**.

**Small eyes** with **ten segments to antennae** and **two segmented apical club**. **Propodeum rounded with no spines**.

Subterranean aggressive ant raiding broods of larger ants, eating their larvae and pupae, as well as tending aphids.

## Nest
Under deeply buried stones and rock clefts in coastal cliff where falls provide bare habitats, with colonies, consisting of numerous workers and multiple queens, often associated with *Lasius flavus* and *Formica* species. Nests formed from single queens or by nest budding. Pupae naked.
