## Worker
Introduced member of subfamily *Myrmicinae*, dispersed by human commercial activity, with two segments to waist and sting present.

Like *Monomorium pharaonis* [propodeum](#glossary) rounded with no spines but bicoloured with uniformly dark brown head and [gaster](#glossary).

Slow moving workers forming trails scavenging on household food material.

## Nest
In small cavities of heated buildings and greenhouses, with multiple small nests containing many queens, new nest formed by budding. Pupae naked [@Wetterer-2010].
