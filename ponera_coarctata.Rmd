## Worker
Member of subfamily *Ponerinae* with **single thick waisted segment**, **constriction between first and second gaster segments** and **well developed sting**. Head with **minute eyes**.

Unlike *Hypoponera punctatissima* **coarsely punctured** with **backward pointing projection on underside of petiole**.

Sluggish, mainly subterranean predator on developmental stages of underground invertebrates. Found in or close to other ant nests, often with *Myrmecina graminicola*. Collected using mince meat baits and sieving moss.

## Nest
Very small tunnels through soil, beneath stones with few workers and a single queen. Nest in hot sites which do not dry out, clay on chalk downs, open stony ground, grassland, crumbling cliffs and open woodland, waste ground, scrub and large urban gardens. Pupae enclosed in cocoons.
