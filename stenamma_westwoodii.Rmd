## Worker
Member of *Myrmicinae* with **two segments to waist** and **sting present**.

Like *Stenamma debile* small and slender ant, slow moving with small eyes, **elongate petiole**, **small propodeal spines** and **two ridges along middle portion of clypeus** but **central smooth frontal area less than a third of the total width between antennal bases** and **legs longer and narrower**.

Scavenger of small invertebrates in leaf litter.

## Nest
Small nests, with around one hundred workers, under large deeply embedded stones, inside hollow flints, other buried cavities in total shade of old woodland and hedgerows. May prefer more open habitat than *Stenamma debile*. Pupae naked.
