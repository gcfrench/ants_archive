## Worker
Member of *Myrmicinae* with two segments to waist and sting present.

Like *Myrmica rubra* and *Myrmica ruginodis* [antennal scape](#glossary) curved with ball and socket joint on same axis but workers larger, bicoloured with darker head and [gaster](#glossary) and more rugose, with heavily sculptured sides and sculptured frontal triangle with upright raised ridges. [Propodeal spines](#glossary) are long and parallel with convergent tips with transverse furrows on base. [Petiole](#glossary) without a distinct [peduncle](#glossary), having a steep anterior face.

Scavenger and predator on invertebrates.

## Nest
In peaty humps, under stones or in clumps of sun exposed peat in sparsely vegetated wet upland or lowland heaths, intolerant of successional change to tall heather or dense *Molinia* grass. Nest often with single queen and around one hundred workers but can contain multiple queens. Pupae naked (@Elmes-1987).
