In addition articles relating to specific species are referenced within the relevant species pages.\n\nSpecies included with these notes are taken from the latest checklist of British ants within the British and Irish Hymenoptera - aculates (@Else-2016).\n\nThe distribution maps were created from records collated by the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society and made publically available through the NBN Gateway in March 2014 [@BWARSdata; @NBNGateway]. The map images were generated using the Atlas Grade Maps facility [@NBNAtlas], under the NBN Gateway terms and conditions [@NBNTC].\n\nThe line drawings of the side and head of an ant used in the glossary where drawn by Steve Shattuck at Australian National Insect Collection, Canberra, Australia and accessed online through the Morphology, Anatomy and Terminology section of the AntWiki website [@AntWiki]. The morphological terms used in the species pages are linked to these line drawings within the glossary.\n\n```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}\nknitr::include_graphics(c(\"images//markers//marker_solid_filled.png\",\n                          \"images//markers//marker_dashed_filled.png\",\n                          \"images//markers//marker_solid_hollow.png\",\n                          \"images//markers//marker_dashed_hollow.png\"\n                          ))\n```\n`r margin_note(\"Annotated markers, species character shown by filled circle and genus or sub-family character by empty circle. Visible character indicated by solid line and hidden character by dashed line.\")`\n\nThe images of the ants were taken from AntWeb [@Antweb] under Creative Commons Attribution Licence [@CC-BY-3] and annotated to highlight important characters for identification.\n\nThe pdf document was generated by the free software R language (@R-base), using a number of packages (@R-markdown; @R-bookdown; @R-knitr; @R-tufte) to convert R Markdown into the final document layout.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n",
