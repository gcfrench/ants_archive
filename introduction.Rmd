# **Introduction** {-}

These notes on the British species of ants were made whilst reading a number of books [@Donisthorpe; @Czechowski; @Pontin; @Skinner-1987; @Skinner-1996; @Collins-2016], pdf files [@Macdonald], journal articles [@stenamma-1993] and online resources [@AntWiki; @BWARS].

The distribution maps were created from records collated by the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society and made publically available through the NBN Gateway in March 2014 [@BWARSdata; @NBNGateway]. The map images were generated using the Atlas Grade Maps facility [@NBNAtlas], under the NBN Gateway terms and conditions [@NBNTC].

                          ))
```
`r margin_note("Annotated markers, species character shown by filled circle and genus or sub-family character by empty circle. Visible character indicated by solid line and hidden character by dashed line.")`

The images of the ants were taken from AntWeb [@Antweb] under Creative Commons Attribution Licence [@CC-BY-3] and annotated to highlight important characters for identification.
