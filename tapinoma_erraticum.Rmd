## Worker
Member of subfamily *Dolichoderinae* with single waist hidden under gaster and sting absent.

Like *Tapinoma subboreale* raises gaster when disturbed producing distinctive repellent smell and has transverse posterior orifice slit but clypeus anterior margins deep and parallel sided.

Agile and aggressive workers, predating on invertebrates and occasionally tending aphids.

## Nest
Small mounds of coarse debris, around small plants or metal object, under stones or bare ground on hot dry heathland sites, often with small raised solaria of soil and vegetation fragments. Nest contains many queens and hundreds of workers. Pupae naked.
