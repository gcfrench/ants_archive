## Alates
Member of *Myrmicinae* with **two segments to waist** and **sting present**.

Queen with **median longitudinal depression on the dorsal surface of the gaster**, becoming massively swollen with eggs. ^[physogastric] Male pupoidal and **wingless**.

Mating occurs within the host nest with many mated queens flying out from  May to August in search of new host nests. Either adopt an old queenless colony of *Tetramorium caespitum* or host queen killed or starved.

## Nest
Parasitic on *Tetramorium caespitum*, with no workers. No new host workers produced as entire host resources switched to producing large numbers of new *Anergates atratulus* queens and males. Host colony dies out within two to five years. 

Unlike the host's white larvae with hairs on head, larvae **yellow** with **naked head**. Pupae naked.
